## Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundation course: [odin-recipe](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) course. It is a basic recipe website that uses a variety of HTML tags, including:

* Headings
* Hyperlinks (href)
* Ordered and unordered lists
* Images

This project is not styled, but it is a good starting point for learning how to create a basic website with HTML.
